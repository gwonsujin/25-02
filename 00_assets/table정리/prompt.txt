You are given a series of class note texts.
Your task is to automatically consolidate ALL provided notes into a single, comprehensive 2x1 Markdown study table.

RULES:
1.  **Output ONLY the final Markdown table** (no extra explanation, no comments, no surrounding text).
2.  **Table columns:** "주제/단락" | "내용"
3.  **Content source:** Use ALL provided text content (including any content pasted within this message).
4.  **Row Generation:** Each distinct idea, bullet point (❑, ▪, •, -), or heading becomes a separate row.
5.  **Left Column ("주제/단락"):** Must be a short, semantic Korean topic name for the content on that row.
6.  **Right Column ("내용"):** Must contain a clean, complete, and logical Korean explanation/definition for the topic.
7.  **Formatting:** No special markdown (no bold, no <br>, no bullets) *inside* the table cells.
8.  **Order:** Preserve the logical sequence of the original notes as closely as possible.
9.  **Final File Name:** The complete table should be treated as the content for a single file named **"CPU_Combined_Notes.md"**.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[Start the final output with the Markdown table only.]
